# CensusVis demo

**NOTE:** Requires Shiny 0.9.0 or later.

CensusVis allows the user to visualize county-level demographic data from the 2010 US Census. These data can be visualized in terms of percent and population, visually demonstrating the differences between high percentage and high population. Data are displayed as tables and on a State or US map.
